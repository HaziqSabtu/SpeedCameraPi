Pinhole Camera Model</h1>
<p>The utilization of the pinhole camera model in computer vision and image processing has been widespread. Its origin dates back to the fifth century BC, when Mo Jing, a Chinese Mohist philosopher, described a similar design utilizing a closed room and a hole in the wall <b>[Ye2014]</b>. Later in the tenth century AD, the Arabian physicist and mathematician Ibn al-Haytham, also known as Alhazen, conducted experiments on image formation. He placed three candles in a row, a screen with a small hole between them and the wall, and noticed that images were only formed by the small holes, and the candle to the right created an image on the wall to the left <b>[Bekele13]</b>.</p>
<div class="image">

<div class="caption">
Example of Pinhole Camera Model \cite Ye2014</div></div>
 <p>The pinhole camera model is fundamental in computer vision, and the concept is often used as a reference for developing more complex camera models. It is a single-point perspective camera model that assumes that each point in the object space projects through a single point in the image plane (Figure pinholemodel}) <b>[Huang14]</b>. The model contains three main components: the image plane, focal length, and optical center <b>[Nogueira19]</b>. The image plane is where the light rays from the object space are projected and where an inverted image is formed <b>[Tomasi15]</b>. The optical center, on the other hand, is where the light rays from the object space intersect, and it is located at a focal length distance from the image plane <b>[Tomasi15]</b>.</p>

Object Distance from Camera</h1>

<div class="caption">
Figure of Pinhole Camera Model</div></div>
 <p>The diagram in Figure above shows the formation of an image of an object in the image plane. The object, \(O\), is located at a distance of \(O_d\) from the optical center, \(C\) where the light rays from the object space intersect. It will then form an inverted image of the object at the image plane, \(I\), which located at a distance of \(f\) from the optical center. \(O_h\) represents the height of the object in real world and \(I_h\) represents the height of the object in image plane. \(S_h\) is the height of the image plane or the sensor size of the camera.</p>
<p>The mathematical equations for the pinhole camera model are derived based on the assumptions that the projection of the object is a point <b>[Huang14]</b> and that light propagates in a straight line <b>[bhathal09]</b>. From these assumptions, we can derive the following equations:</p>
<p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:1} \frac{O_h}{O_d} = \frac{I_h}{f} \end{equation}</p>
<p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:2} \frac{S_h}{I_h} = \frac{S_{hpix}}{I_{hpix}} \end{equation}</p>
<p>Assuming that the camera utilizes 100% of the sensor size <b>[picamDoc]</b>, the following equation can be derived to relate the sensor size and image resolution, as stated in Equation eq:2} . This equation assumes that the ratio of sensor size, \(S_h\), to focal length, \(f \), remains constant in comparison to the ratio of image resolution, \(S_{hpix}\), and object size in pixels at the image plane, \(I_{hpix}\) . By using this relationship, the value of \(I_h\) in Equation eq:1} can be substituted to calculate the distance of the object from the camera using the following equation:</p>
<p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:3} O_d = {f} \cdot \frac{S_{hpix}}{S_h} \cdot \frac{O_h}{I_{hpix}} \end{equation}</p>
<p>One can obtain the parameters \(S_{hpix}\) and \(f\) directly from the camera specifications or manufacturer. For instance, the Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2 used in this project has a sensor size of 3.68 mm x 2.76 mm, and a focal length of 3.04 mm <b>[pi]</b>. It is worth noting that the sensor size varies in width and height, and the choice of which value to use in the calculation depends on the camera's orientation concerning the object's position.</p>
<p>While \(S_{hpix}\) depends on the camera resolution, \(I_{hpix}\) value can be measured directly from the image. However, we are left with an unknown variable, \(O_h\), representing the object's height in the real world. Hence, to compute the object's distance from the camera, one must know the object's height in the real world.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md46"></a>
Speed Calculation</h1>
<p>To determine the speed of a moving object, one can calculate the distance it travels within a given time interval. This can be done by subtracting the distance of the object in the previous frame from the distance of the object in the current frame. Similarly, the time interval can be calculated by subtracting the time of the previous frame from the current frame's time. Therefore, the formula for determining the speed of the object is derived.</p>
<p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:4} Speed = \frac{|d_{current} - d_{previous}|}{t_{current} - t_{previous}} \end{equation}</p>
<p>However, as previously mentioned in {objectdistance}, the object's dimension in the real world must be known to obtain an accurate result in the calculation. A constant object size in the real world must be utilized to ensure consistency in the calculation. In this project, the width of the road, which has an average value of 3.5 meters in Germany, will be utilized as the object size <b>[Autobahn]</b>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md47"></a>
Proposed Algorithm</h1>
<div class="image">
<img src="algo.jpg" alt=""/>
<div class="caption">
Proposed Algorithm</div></div>
 <p>Figure {algorithm} illustrates the proposed algorithm, which commences by acquiring images from the camera. Next, the image alignment algorithm processes the images to eliminate any perspective distortion and ensure proper alignment. The object detection algorithm then employs optical flow to detect moving objects in the image.</p>
<p>User input is required to select the line that represents the width of the road, as the calculation requires the real-world size of the object, as explained in {objectdistance}. Once the line selection is made, the speed of the detected object can be calculated. The calculation results are displayed on the screen, and the process is terminated. </p>
