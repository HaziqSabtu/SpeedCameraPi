If these dependencies are not installed properly, the compilation process of your project may fail or produce unexpected errors during runtime.

The following sections will guide you through the installation process of these dependencies on Raspberry Pi 4 running Debian. The installation process may involve downloading and compiling the source code yourself or using a package manager to install pre-\/built binary packages. You may skip this section if the required dependencies are already installed.\hypertarget{md__docs_markdown__installing_required_dependency_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{Installing Open\+CV}\label{md__docs_markdown__installing_required_dependency_autotoc_md6}
Open\+CV is a powerful computer vision library that provides a vast range of image and video processing capabilities. This project uses Open\+CV to perform image processing tasks such as detecting and tracking objects in the video stream.

Steps to install Open\+CV on Raspberry Pi 4 running Debian\+: \href{https://qengineering.eu/install-opencv-4.5-on-raspberry-pi-4.html}{\texttt{ \mbox{[}source\mbox{]}}}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Update the package list and upgrade all packages to their latest versions\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
\end{DoxyVerb}

\item Increase the swap size to 4096MByte to prevent the system from running out of memory during the compilation process\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
\end{DoxyVerb}

\item Once the file is opened in the Nano editor, locate the \char`\"{}\+CONF\+\_\+\+SWAPSIZE\char`\"{} line, which specifies the maximum size of the swap file.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item By default, the value of this variable is set to 100, which means that the swap file will be limited to 100MByte. Change this value to 4096MByte by replacing 100 with 4096.
\item Save the changes and exit the editor by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter. \begin{DoxyVerb}    CONF_SWAPSIZE=4096
\end{DoxyVerb}

\item Next, run the following command\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    sudo nano /sbin/dphys-swapfile
\end{DoxyVerb}

\item Increase CONF\+\_\+\+MAXSWAP to 4096MByte \begin{DoxyVerb}    CONF_MAXSWAP=4096
\end{DoxyVerb}

\item Reboot the system to apply the changes to the swap file\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    sudo reboot
\end{DoxyVerb}

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Now that the swap file has been increased, you can proceed with the installation of Open\+CV.
\item Download the installation script\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  wget https://github.com/Qengineering/Install-OpenCV-Raspberry-Pi-32-bits/raw/main/OpenCV-4-5-5.sh

  sudo chmod 755 ./OpenCV-4-5-5.sh
\end{DoxyVerb}

\item Useful tips before compiling the library (optional)\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item During compilation process, you may encounter an error message that says \char`\"{}\+Out of memory\char`\"{}. This means that the system ran out of memory and the compilation process was terminated. To fix this issue, you can reduce the number of threads used by the compiler by changing the value of the \char`\"{}-\/j\char`\"{} flag in the script.
\item By doing so may increase the compilation time.
\item To change the number of threads, open the installation script in the Nano editor\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    sudo nano ./OpenCV-4-5-5.sh
\end{DoxyVerb}

\item locate the following line and change the value of the \char`\"{}-\/j\char`\"{} flag to 1\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    make -j1
\end{DoxyVerb}

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Compile the library \begin{DoxyVerb}  ./OpenCV-4-5-5.sh
\end{DoxyVerb}

\item The installation script will take about 2 hours to complete. Once it is finished, reboot the system to apply the changes\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  sudo reboot
\end{DoxyVerb}

\item Make sure to set swap size to original value after finish installation
