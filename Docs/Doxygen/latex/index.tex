This project aims to develop a speed camera algorithm using Raspberry Pi and computer vision techniques. The algorithm consists of three main components\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Image alignment with feature detection
\item Object detection with optical flow
\item Speed calculation with pinhole camera
\end{DoxyItemize}

The proposed algorithm offers a low-\/cost, accurate, and real-\/time speed detection solution that can contribute to improving road safety and reducing the incidence of speeding.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Results}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
The proposed speed camera algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of moving vehicles, balls, and cats. The results showed high accuracy and effectiveness in detecting and measuring the speed of the objects. The error rate in speed calculation was around 6\%, which is comparable to traditional speed cameras.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Future Work}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
Explore alternative feature detection and tracking techniques to improve the efficiency of the image alignment and object detection algorithms.

Investigate dynamic thresholding techniques to increase the flexibility of the object detection algorithm in different scenarios.

Develop more robust speed calculation methods that are not limited by the camera angle or position.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Contributing}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
