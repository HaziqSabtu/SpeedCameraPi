  abstract = {Pixel-parallel FAST and SIFT feature detection algorithms are proposed, which are suitable for the vision chip architecture. The proposed algorithms can execute the FAST and SIFT feature detections on the vision chip in a pixel-parallel manner. The Feature detection utilising the proposed algorithms can be realised by basic logic and arithmetic operations. Experiments and detailed analysis show that the proposed algorithms can perform feature detection on the vision chip at a higher speed compared with that on a general processor or an application-specific circuit.},
