  abstract = {Pixel-parallel FAST and SIFT feature detection algorithms are proposed, which are suitable for the vision chip architecture. The proposed algorithms can execute the FAST and SIFT feature detections on the vision chip in a pixel-parallel manner. The Feature detection utilising the proposed algorithms can be realised by basic logic and arithmetic operations. Experiments and detailed analysis show that the proposed algorithms can perform feature detection on the vision chip at a higher speed compared with that on a general processor or an application-specific circuit.},

  abstract = {This article presents a novel scale- and rotation-invariant detector and descriptor, coined SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features). SURF approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster. This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (specifically, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper encompasses a detailed description of the detector and descriptor and then explores the effects of the most important parameters. We conclude the article with SURF’s application to two challenging, yet converse goals: camera calibration as a special case of image registration, and object recognition. Our experiments underline SURF’s usefulness in a broad range of topics in computer vision.}

  abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

  abstract = {A pinhole camera collects rays passing through a common 3D point and its image resembles what would be seen by human eyes. In contrast, a non-pinhole (multi-perspective) camera combines rays collected by different viewpoints. Despite their incongruity of view, their images are able to preserve spatial coherence and can depict, within a single context, details of a scene that are simultaneously inaccessible from a single view, yet easily interpretable by a viewer. In this paper, we thoroughly discuss the design, modeling, and implementation of a broad class of non-pinhole cameras and their applications in computer graphics and vision. These include mathematical (conceptual) camera models such as the General Linear Cameras and real non-pinhole cameras such as catadioptric cameras and projectors. A unique component of this paper is a ray geometry analysis that uniformly models these non-pinhole cameras as manifolds of rays and ray constraints. We also model the thin lens as a ray transform and study how ray geometry is changed by the thin lens for studying distortions and defocusing. We hope to provide mathematical fundamentals to satisfy computer vision researchers as well as tools and algorithms to aid computer graphics and optical engineering researchers.},
