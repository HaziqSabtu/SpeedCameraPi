# SpeedCameraPi(SCP)

This application is designed to measure the speed of moving vehicles using computer vision. The software uses advanced algorithms and image processing technique that available nowadays to analyze video footage captured by a camera. This application can accurately detect and track moving vehicles, and then calculate their speed based on the distance and time they travel between two frames.

For a first contact withÂ SCP, the best place is to have a look at the getting started page that show you how to compile the application.
